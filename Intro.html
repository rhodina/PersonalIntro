<p> Hi my name is Rhodina Waldner and I’m working on my Associates degree in Computer Programming. </p>

<p>My favorite culture that I’m not native to would be India. 
The landscape varies from the Himalayan mountains to beaches, deserts, plains, and forests. 
It is the birthplace of yoga and meditation. The clothes are vibrant colors and designs, and their food is amazing. </p>

<p>Two historical figures I could relate to would be Gandhi, for his principle of non-violence, 
and Saint Francis, for his love of nature and animals.</p>

<p>A meal that represents me would be Sesame chicken and Lo Mein noodles with crab rangoons. </p>

<p>I feel most creative when I am surrounded by people that I love. </p>
